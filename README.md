The AALM_v3-1.zip contains all files necessary to run the All Ages Lead Model (AALM) version 3.1 and its new respiratory module. The AALM v3.1 64-bit executable and the user interface have been most extensively tested on computers having Windows 11 Enterprise operating system with Microsoft 365 Excel. The AALM v3.1 32-bit executable has only been tested to determine its limited functionality as discussed in the users guide. 

To begin to use the model, unzip the zip file into a folder on your c:\ drive where you have read/write privileges. There are no other installation procedures. Generally, computer users will have read/write access within *c:\users\{your username}\\*. Due to security safeguards, the AALM model will typically not run from your PC's Documents folder or any network drive. 

After unzipping files, the AALM is started by opening AALM_Inputs_v3-1.xlsm, where v3-1 indicates version 3.1. This is the AALM's user interface to setup and run simulations. Results of a simulation are viewed in AALM_ExploreData_v3-1.xlsm. The first time these files are opened, there may be a red banner under the Excel menu bar reading, *SECURITY RISK  Microsoft has blocked macros from running because the source of this file is untrusted.* To resolve this issue, exit Excel. From the File Explorer, right click on the filename and select properties. At the bottom of the file Properties, notice the Security warning. Click on the box by Unblock, then press \<OK>. The next time a file is opened, there may be a yellow banner under the Excel menu bar reading, *SECURITY WARNING  Some active content has been disable.* To resolve this issue, press the \<Enable Content> button to the right of the warning. The model is now ready to run simulations. You can save the Excel files to filenames of your preference for each of your different simulations. 

To familiarize yourself with the model it is recommended that you import and run example simulations. Within the "Examples" folder, there are eight examples with detailed descriptions of these examples found within the "AALM Example Scenarios" appendix of the Users Guide for the AALM v3.1. The User Guide also contains detailed descriptions of how to modify settings within the AALM user interface as well as troubleshooting. Four additional simulation examples are included as part of the respiratory module located in the "RespMod" folder. Chapter 2 and Appendix 6 of the Respiratory Module Documentation should be consulted for more information about these examples. Details related AALM exposure and biokinetic parameters, model optimization, and model evaluation are found within the Technical Support Document for the AALM v3.0. 

Model support is available from brown.james@epa.gov and PbHelp@epa.gov.
